							<p>Testing is usually a subset of different parts of the SDLC, but the testing phase refers exclusively to testing where  system flaws are reported, tracked, fixed and retested, until the product reaches the quality standards defined in the SRS. In this stage, testers will use the test cases they've developed to find flaws in the code and  report to the bug tracking system. A developer will then solve the problem and send it back once the issue has been resolved. This is known as a bug life cycle which conists of 6 stages. an example is  e.g.
								user logs out but doesnt actually logout and someone else logs in. it includes:

								Programmers will use tools like Integrated Development environments, compilers, interpreters and debuggers to generate code. They will also use different High level programming languages such as C, C++, Pascal, Java and PHP to code with respect to the type of software being developed.

					<p> The Spiral Model is the most flexible out of all the SDLC models. It combines the the iterative model's emphasis on repitition and the waterfall model.  The spiral model goes through the planning, design, build and testing phases over and over, with gradual improvements at each pass. The software is developed in a serires of incremental releases. Each phase begins with the design goal and ends with client reviewing the result.

It separates the product into cycles and delivers a working product very quickly. This methodology produces a succession of releases. Testing of each release feeds back info that’s incorporated into the next version. According to Robert Half, the drawback of this model is that the heavy emphasis on customer interaction can lead the project in the wrong direction in some cases.
